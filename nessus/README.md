### Nessus Parser

This python script will parse .nessus files and output individual CSV files per host into the 'output/' folder. These files are formatted specifically for oneVault asset project uploads, but can be used and modified as needed.

```
 # python3 nessus_parser_oneVault.py <my_nessus_scan.nessus>

```
