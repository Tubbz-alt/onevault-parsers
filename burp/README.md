### Burp Parser

This python script will parse BurpSuite XML project files and output CSV files per asset into the 'output/' folder. These files are formatted specifically for oneVault asset project uploads, but can be used and modified as needed.

```
 # python3 burp_parser_oneVault.py <my_burp_project.xml>

```
